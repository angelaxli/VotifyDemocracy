Once you have your API key, you can start querying the Civic Information API to retrieve representative data. The correct endpoint to use is https://www.googleapis.com/civicinfo/v2/representatives. You’ll also need to supply an address as a query parameter. The address should be in plain text (e.g., “1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC”) but encoded for URLs using encodeURIComponent() if you're using JavaScript. Your full URL might look something like this:
https://www.googleapis.com/civicinfo/v2/representatives?key=YOUR_API_KEY&address=1600+Pennsylvania+Ave+NW,+Washington,+DC.

The API will return a JSON object with three major sections: divisions, offices, and officials. The offices array contains each elected office (like “U.S. Senator” or “Mayor”), and each office entry contains an array called officialIndices, which links to one or more entries in the officials array — these are the actual people holding those positions. Each office may also include a levels field that indicates the level of government. This field is key to categorizing representatives. If the level is "country", the rep is at the federal level. If the level is "administrativeArea1", it corresponds to state government. Levels such as "administrativeArea2", "locality", "regional", or any variant containing “subLocality” typically indicate local positions.

If the levels field is missing from an office, you can infer the rep’s scope from the divisionId field, which shows a structured hierarchy like ocd-division/country:us/state:ca/county:san_francisco — in this case, indicating a local or county-level office. Once you’ve matched each office to its corresponding officials via the officialIndices, you can create your own categorized structure in your code, such as separate arrays or JSON keys for “federal,” “state,” and “local.”

In practice, this means looping through all offices, checking the levels field (or inferring from divisionId if missing), and grouping the linked officials accordingly. Each grouped official can be displayed with their name, title (from the office name), party affiliation, contact info, and photo if available.

While the API does not explicitly label reps as “federal,” “state,” or “local,” the levels and divisionId fields give you enough metadata to reliably determine their jurisdiction and organize your data accordingly. This technique is widely used by civic tech platforms and is in line with Google’s intended design for the API.
